Abstract
With the increasing use of research paper
search engines, such as CiteSeer, for both literature
search and hiring decisions, the accuracy
of such systems is of paramount importance.
This paper employs Conditional Random
Fields (CRFs) for the task of extracting
various common fields from the headers and
citation of research papers. The basic theory
of CRFs is becoming well-understood, but
best-practices for applying them to real-world
data requires additional exploration. This paper
makes an empirical exploration of several factors,
including variations on Gaussian, exponential
and hyperbolic-L1 priors for improved
regularization, and several classes of features
and Markov order. On a standard benchmark
data set, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance,
reducing error in average F1 by 36%,
and word error rate by 78%in comparison with
the previous best SVM results. Accuracy compares
even more favorably against HMMs.
1 Introduction
Research paper search engines, such as CiteSeer
(Lawrence et al., 1999) and Cora (McCallum et al.,
2000), give researchers tremendous power and convenience
in their research. They are also becoming increasingly
used for recruiting and hiring decisions. Thus the
information quality of such systems is of significant importance.
This quality critically depends on an information
extraction component that extracts meta-data, such
as title, author, institution, etc, from paper headers and
references, because these meta-data are further used in
many component applications such as field-based search,
author analysis, and citation analysis.
Previous work in information extraction from research
papers has been based on two major machine learning
techniques. The first is hidden Markov models
(HMM) (Seymore et al., 1999; Takasu, 2003). An
HMM learns a generative model over input sequence
and labeled sequence pairs. While enjoying wide historical
success, standard HMM models have difficulty
modeling multiple non-independent features of the observation
sequence. The second technique is based
on discriminatively-trained SVM classifiers (Han et al.,
2003). These SVM classifiers can handle many nonindependent
features. However, for this sequence labeling
problem, Han et al. (2003) work in a two stages process:
first classifying each line independently to assign it
label, then adjusting these labels based on an additional
classifier that examines larger windows of labels. Solving
the information extraction problem in two steps looses
the tight interaction between state transitions and observations.
In this paper, we present results on this research paper
meta-data extraction task using a Conditional Random
Field (Lafferty et al., 2001), and explore several practical
issues in applying CRFs to information extraction in
general. The CRF approach draws together the advantages
of both finite state HMM and discriminative SVM
techniques by allowing use of arbitrary, dependent features
and joint inference over entire sequences.
CRFs have been previously applied to other tasks such
as name entity extraction (McCallum and Li, 2003), table
extraction (Pinto et al., 2003) and shallow parsing (Sha
and Pereira, 2003). The basic theory of CRFs is now
well-understood, but the best-practices for applying them
to new, real-world data is still in an early-exploration
phase. Here we explore two key practical issues: (1) regularization,
with an empirical study of Gaussian (Chen
and Rosenfeld, 2000), exponential (Goodman, 2003), and
hyperbolic-L1 (Pinto et al., 2003) priors; (2) exploration
of various families of features, including text, lexicons,
and layout, as well as proposing a method for the beneficial
use of zero-count features without incurring large
memory penalties.
We describe a large collection of experimental results
on two traditional benchmark data sets. Dramatic improvements
are obtained in comparison with previous
SVM and HMM based results.
2 Conditional Random Fields
Conditional random fields (CRFs) are undirected graphical
models trained to maximize a conditional probability
(Lafferty et al., 2001). A common special-case graph
structure is a linear chain, which corresponds to a finite
state machine, and is suitable for sequence labeling. A
linear-chain CRF with parameters  = {, ...} defines
a conditional probability for a state (or label1) sequence
y = y1...yT given an input sequence x = x1...xT to be
P(y|x) =
1
Zx
exp
 
XT
t=1
X
k
kfk(yt-1, yt, x, t)
!
,
(1)
where Zx is the normalization constant that makes
the probability of all state sequences sum to one,
fk(yt-1, yt, x, t) is a feature function which is often
binary-valued, but can be real-valued, and k is a learned
weight associated with feature fk. The feature functions
can measure any aspect of a state transition, yt-1 ! yt,
and the observation sequence, x, centered at the current
time step, t. For example, one feature function might
have value 1 when yt-1 is the state TITLE, yt is the state
AUTHOR, and xt is a word appearing in a lexicon of people’s
first names. Large positive values for k indicate a
preference for such an event, while large negative values
make the event unlikely.
Given such a model as defined in Equ. (1), the most
probable labeling sequence for an input x,
y
 = argmax
y
P(y|x),
can be efficiently calculated by dynamic programming
using the Viterbi algorithm. Calculating the marginal
probability of states or transitions at each position in
the sequence by a dynamic-programming-based inference
procedure very similar to forward-backward for hidden
Markov models.
The parameters may be estimated by maximum
likelihood—maximizing the conditional probability of
a set of label sequences, each given their corresponding
input sequences. The log-likelihood of training set
1We consider here only finite state models in which there is
a one-to-one correspondence between states and labels; this is
not, however, strictly necessary.

CRFs share many of the advantageous properties of
standard maximum entropy models, including their convex
likelihood function, which guarantees that the learning
procedure converges to the global maximum. Traditional
maximum entropy learning algorithms, such as
GIS and IIS (Pietra et al., 1995), can be used to train
CRFs, however, it has been found that a quasi-Newton
gradient-climber, BFGS, convergesmuch faster (Malouf,
2002; Sha and Pereira, 2003). We use BFGS for optimization.
In our experiments, we shall focus instead on
two other aspects of CRF deployment, namely regularization
and selection of differentmodel structure and feature
types.
2.1 Regularization in CRFs
To avoid over-fitting, log-likelihood is often penalized by
some prior distribution over the parameters. Figure 1
shows an empirical distribution of parameters, , learned
from an unpenalized likelihood, including only features
with non-zero count in the training set. Three prior distributions
that have shape similar to this empirical distribution
are the Gaussian prior, exponential prior, and
hyperbolic-L1 prior, each shown in Figure 2. In this paper
we provide an empirical study of these three priors.

2.1.1 Gaussian prior
With a Gaussian prior, log-likelihood (2) is penalized
as follows:

P(y|x)fk(yt-1, yt, xi, t)
This adjusted constraint (as well as the adjustments imposed
by the other two priors) is intuitively understandable:
rather than matching exact empirical feature frequencies,
the model is tuned to match discounted feature
frequencies. Chen and Rosenfeld (2000) discuss this in
the context of other discounting procedures common in
language modeling. We call the term subtracted from the
empirical counts (in this case k/2) a discounted value.
The variance can be feature dependent. However for
simplicity, constant variance is often used for all features.
In this paper, however, we experiment with several alternate
versions of Gaussian prior in which the variance is
feature dependent.
Although Gaussian (and other) priors are gradually
overcome by increasing amounts of training data, perhaps
not at the right rate. The three methods below all
provide ways to alter this rate by changing the variance
of the Gaussian prior dependent on feature counts.
1. Threshold Cut: In language modeling, e.g, Good-
Turing smoothing, only low frequency words are
smoothed. Here we apply the same idea and only
smooth those features whose frequencies are lower
than a threshold (7 in our experiments, following
standard practice in language modeling).
2. Divide Count: Here we let the discounted value
for a feature depend on its frequency in the training
set, ck =
P
i
P
t fk(yt-1, yt, x, t). The discounted
value used here is k
ck×2 where  is a constant over
all features. In this way, we increase the smoothing
on the low frequency features more so than the high
frequency features.
3. Bin-Based: We divide features into classes based
on frequency. We bin features by frequency in the
training set, and let the features in the same bin share
the same variance. The discounted value is set to be
k
dck/Ne×2 where ck is the count of features, N is
the bin size, and dae is the ceiling function. Alternatively,
the variance in each bin may be set independently
by cross-validation.
2.1.2 Exponential prior
Whereas the Gaussian prior penalizes according to the
square of the weights (an L2 penalizer), the intention here
is to create a smoothly differentiable analogue to penalizing
the absolute-value of the weights (an L1 penalizer).
L1 penalizers often result in more “sparse solutions,” in
which many features have weight nearly at zero, and thus
provide a kind of soft feature selection that improves generalization.
Goodman (2003) proposes an exponential prior,
specifically a Laplacian prior, as an alternative to Gaussian
prior. Under this prior,
L =
X
i
log P(yi|xi) -
X
k
k|k| (4)
where k is a parameter in exponential distribution.
Maximizing (4) would satisfy
X
i
fk(yt-1, yt, xi, t)-k =
X
i
P(y|x)fk(yt-1, yt, xi, t)
This corresponds to the absolute smoothing method in
language modeling. We set the k = ; i.e. all features
share the same constant whose value can be determined
using absolute discounting  = n1
n1+2n2
, where n1 and n2
are the number of features occurring once and twice (Ney
et al., 1995).
2.1.3 Hyperbolic-L1 prior
Another L1 penalizer is the hyperbolic-L1 prior, described
in (Pinto et al., 2003). The hyperbolic distribution
has log-linear tails. Consequently the class of hyperbolic
distribution is an important alternative to the class of normal
distributions and has been used for analyzing data
from various scientific areas such as finance, though less
frequently used in natural language processing.
Under a hyperbolic prior,
L =X
i
log P(yi|xi) -X
k
log(
ek + e-k
2
) (5)
which corresponds to satisfying
X
i
fk(yt-1, yt, xi, t) -
e|k| - e-|k|
e|k| + e-|k| =
X
i
P(y|x)fi(yt-1, yt, xi, t)
The hyperbolic prior was also tested with CRFs in Mc-
Callum and Li (2003).
2.2 Exploration of Feature Space
Wise choice of features is always vital the performance
of any machine learning solution. Feature induction (Mc-
Callum, 2003) has been shown to provide significant improvements
in CRFs performance. In some experiments
described below we use feature induction. The focus in
this section is on three other aspects of the feature space.
2.2.1 State transition features
In CRFs, state transitions are also represented as features.
The feature function fk(yt-1, yt, x, t) in Equ. (1)
is a general function over states and observations. Different
state transition features can be defined to form different
Markov-order structures. We define four different
state transitions features corresponding to different
Markov order for different classes of features. Higher
order features model dependencies better, but also create
more data sparse problem and require more memory in
training.
1. First-order: Here the inputs are examined in the context
of the current state only. The feature functions
are represented as f(yt, x). There are no separate
parameters or preferences for state transitions at all.
2. First-order+transitions: Here we add parameters
corresponding to state transitions. The feature functions
used are f(yt, x), f(yt-1, yt).
3. Second-order: Here inputs are examined in the context
of the current and previous states. Feature function
are represented as f(yt-1, yt, x).
4. Third-order: Here inputs are examined in the context
of the current, two previous states. Feature function
are represented as f(yt-2, yt-1, yt, x).
2.2.2 Supported features and unsupported features
Before the use of prior distributions over parameters
was common in maximum entropy classifiers, standard
practice was to eliminate all features with zero count
in the training data (the so-called unsupported features).
However, unsupported, zero-count features can be extremely
useful for pushing Viterbi inference away from
certain paths by assigning such features negative weight.
The use of a prior allows the incorporation of unsupported
features, however, doing so often greatly increases
the number parameters and thus the memory requirements.
Below we experiment with models containing and not
containing unsupported features—both with and without
regularization by priors, and we argue that non-supported
features are useful.
We present here incremental support, a method of introducing
some useful unsupported features without exploding
the number of parameters with all unsupported
features. The model is trained for several iterations with
supported features only. Then inference determines the
label sequences assigned high probability by the model.
Incorrect transitions assigned high probability by the
model are used to selectively add to the model those unsupported
features that occur on those transitions, which
may help improve performance by being assigned negative
weight in future training. If desired, several iterations
of this procedure may be performed.
2.2.3 Local features, layout features and lexicon
features
One of the advantages of CRFs and maximum entropy
models in general is that they easily afford the use of arbitrary
features of the input. One can encode local spelling
features, layout features such as positions of line breaks,
as well as external lexicon features, all in one framework.
We study all these features in our research paper extraction
problem, evaluate their individual contributions, and
give some guidelines for selecting good features.
3 Empirical Study
3.1 Hidden MarkovModels
Here we also briefly describe a HMM model we used
in our experiments. We relax the independence assumption
made in standard HMM and allow Markov dependencies
among observations, e.g., P(ot|st, ot-1). We
can vary Markov orders in state transition and observation
transitions. In our experiments, a model with second
order state transitions and first order observation transitions
performs the best. The state transition probabilities
and emission probabilities are estimated using maximum
likelihood estimation with absolute smoothing, which
was found to be effective in previous experiments, including
Seymore et al. (1999).
3.2 Datasets
We experiment with two datasets of research paper content.
One consists of the headers of research papers. The
other consists of pre-segmented citations from the reference
sections of research papers. These data sets have
been used as standard benchmarks in several previous
studies (Seymore et al., 1999; McCallum et al., 2000;
Han et al., 2003).
3.2.1 Paper header dataset
The header of a research paper is defined to be all of
the words from the beginning of the paper up to either
the first section of the paper, usually the introduction,
or to the end of the first page, whichever occurs first.
It contains 15 fields to be extracted: title, author, affiliation,
address, note, email, date, abstract, introduction,
phone, keywords, web, degree, publication number, and
page (Seymore et al., 1999). The header dataset contains
935 headers. Following previous research (Seymore et
al., 1999; McCallum et al., 2000; Han et al., 2003), for
each trial we randomly select 500 for training and the remaining
435 for testing. We refer this dataset as H.
3.2.2 Paper reference dataset
The reference dataset was created by the Cora
project (McCallum et al., 2000). It contains 500 references,
we use 350 for training and the rest 150 for testing.
References contain 13 fields: author, title, editor,
booktitle, date, journal, volume, tech, institution, pages,
location, publisher, note. We refer this dataset as R.
3.3 PerformanceMeasures
To give a comprehensive evaluation, we measure performance
using several different metrics. In addition to
the previously-usedword accuracy measure (which overemphasizes
accuracy of the abstract field), we use perfield
F1 measure (both for individual fields and averaged
over all fields—called a “macro average” in the information
retrieval literature), and whole instance accuracy for
measuring overall performance in a way that is sensitive
to even a single error in any part of header or citation.
3.3.1 Measuring field-specific performance
1. Word Accuracy: We define A as the number of true
positive words, B as the number of false negative
words, C as the number of false positive words, D
as the number of true negative words, and A + B +
C +D is the total number of words. Word accuracy
is calculated to be A+D
A+B+C+D
2. F1-measure: Precision, recall and F1 measure are
defined as follows. Precision = A
A+C Recall = A
A+B
F1 = 2×Precision×Recall
Precision+Recall
3.3.2 Measuring overall performance
1. Overall word accuracy: Overall word accuracy
is the percentage of words whose predicted labels
equal their true labels. Word accuracy favors fields
with large number of words, such as the abstract.
2. Averaged F-measure: Averaged F-measure is computed
by averaging the F1-measures over all fields.
Average F-measure favors labels with small number
of words, which complements word accuracy.
Thus, we consider both word accuracy and average
F-measure in evaluation.
3. Whole instance accuracy: An instance here is defined
to be a single header or reference. Whole
instance accuracy is the percentage of instances in
which every word is correctly labeled.
3.4 Experimental Results
We first report the overall results by comparing CRFs
with HMMs, and with the previously best benchmark results
obtained by SVMs (Han et al., 2003). We then break
down the results to analyze various factors individually.
Table 1 shows the results on dataset H with the best results
in bold; (intro and page fields are not shown, following
past practice (Seymore et al., 1999; Han et al.,
2003)). The results we obtained with CRFs use secondorder
state transition features, layout features, as well as
supported and unsupported features. Feature induction
is used in experiments on dataset R; (it didn’t improve
accuracy on H). The results we obtained with the HMM
model use a second order model for transitions, and a first
order for observations. The results on SVM is obtained
from (Han et al., 2003) by computing F1 measures from
the precision and recall numbers they report.

3.5 Analysis
3.5.1 Overall performance comparison
From Table (1, 2), one can see that CRF performs
significantly better than HMMs, which again supports

Average F1 77.6% 91.5%
Table 2: Extraction results for paper references on R
2003). CRFs also perform significantly better than SVMbased
approach, yielding new state of the art performance
on this task. CRFs increase the performance on nearly all
the fields. The overall word accuracy is improved from
92.9% to 98.3%, which corresponds to a 78% error rate
reduction. However, as we can see word accuracy can be
misleading since HMMmodel even has a higher word accuracy
than SVM, although it performs much worse than
SVM in most individual fields except abstract. Interestingly,
HMMperformsmuch better on abstract field (98%
versus 93.8% F-measure) which pushes the overall accuracy
up. A better comparison can be made by comparing
the field-based F-measures. Here, in comparison to
the SVM, CRFs improve the F1 measure from 89.7% to
93.9%, an error reduction of 36%.
3.5.2 Effects of regularization
The results of different regularization methods are
summarized in Table (3). Setting Gaussian variance of
features depending on feature count performs better, from
90.5% to 91.2%, an error reduction of 7%, when only
using supported features, and an error reduction of 9%
when using supported and unsupported features. Results
are averaged over 5 random runs, with an average
variance of 0.2%. In our experiments we found the
Gaussian prior to consistently perform better than the
others. Surprisingly, exponential prior hurts the performance
significantly. It over penalizes the likelihood (significantly
increasing cost—defined as negative penalized
log-likelihood). We hypothesized that the problem could
be that the choice of constant  is inappropriate. So we
tried varying  instead of computing it using absolute
discounting, but found the alternatives to perform worse.
These results suggest that Gaussian prior is a safer prior

3.5.3 Effects of exploring feature space
State transition features and unsupported features.
We summarize the comparison of different state transition
models using or not using unsupported features in
Table 4. The first column describes the four different state
transition models, the second column contains the overall
word accuracy of these models using only support features,
and the third column contains the result of using
all features, including unsupported features. Comparing
the rows, one can see that the second-order model performs
the best, but not dramatically better than the firstorder+
transitions and the third ordermodel. However, the
first-order model performs significantly worse. The difference
does not come from sharing the weights, but from
ignoring the f(yt-1, yt). The first order transition feature
is vital here. We would expect the third order model to
perform better if enough training data were available.
Comparing the second and the third columns, we can
see that using all features including unsupported features,
consistently performs better than ignoring them. Our
preliminary experiments with incremental support have
shown performance in between that of supported-only
and all features, and are still ongoing.
Effects of layout features
To analyze the contribution of different kinds of features,
we divide the features into three categories: local
features, layout features, and external lexicon resources.
The features we used are summarized in Table 5.

Table 5: List of features used
The results of using different features are shown in Table
6. The layout feature dramatically increases the performance,
raising the F1 measure from 88.8% to 93.9%,
whole sentence accuracy from 40.1% to 72.4%. Adding
lexicon features alone improves the performance. However,
when combing lexicon features and layout features,
the performance is worse than using layout features
alone.
The lexicons were gathered from a large collection of
BibTeX files, and upon examination had difficult to remove
noise, for example words in the author lexicon that
were also affiliations. In previous work, we have gained
significant benefits by dividing each lexicon into sections
based on point-wise information gain with respect to the
lexicon’s class.
3.5.4 Error analysis
Table 7 is the classification confusion matrix of header
extraction (field page is not shown to save space). Most
Word Acc. F1 Inst. Acc.
local feature 96.5% 88.8% 40.1%
+ lexicon 96.9% 89.9% 53.1%
+ layout feature 98.2% 93.4% 72.4%
+ layout + lexicon 98.0% 93.0% 71.7%

errors happen at the boundaries between two fields. Especially
the transition from author to affiliation, from abstract
to keyword. The note field is the one most confused
with others, and upon inspection is actually labeled
inconsistently in the training data. Other errors could
be fixed with additional feature engineering—for example,
including additional specialized regular expressions
should make email accuracy nearly perfect. Increasing
the amount of training data would also be expected to
help significantly, as indicated by consistent nearly perfect
accuracy on the training set.
4 Conclusions and Future Work
This paper investigates the issues of regularization, feature
spaces, and efficient use of unsupported features in
CRFs, with an application to information extraction from
research papers.
For regularization we find that the Gaussian prior with
variance depending on feature frequencies performs better
than several other alternatives in the literature. Feature
engineering is a key component of any machine learning
solution—especially in conditionally-trained models
with such freedom to choose arbitrary features—and
plays an even more important role than regularization.
We obtain new state-of-the-art performance in extracting
standard fields from research papers, with a significant
error reduction by several metrics. We also suggest
better evaluation metrics to facilitate future research in
this task—especially field-F1, rather than word accuracy.
We have provided an empirical exploration of a few
previously-published priors for conditionally-trained loglinear
models. Fundamental advances in regularization
for CRFs remains a significant open research area.
